# Task
Train and test a phone recogniser based on digit speech material from the TIDIGIT database:\\
• using predefined Gaussian-emission HMM phonetic models, create time aligned phonetic\\
transcriptions of the TIDIGITS database,\\
• define appropriate DNN models for phoneme recognition using Keras,\\
• train and evaluate the DNN models on a frame-by-frame recognition score,\\
• repeat the training by varying model parameters and input features
Optional:\\
• perform and evaluate continuous speech recognition at the phoneme and word level using
Gaussian-emission HMM models\\
• perform and evaluate continuous speech recognition at the phoneme and word level using
DNN-HMM models
